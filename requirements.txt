# Python dependencies for Squadron Comms Plugin

# Audio playback via ElevenLabs MCP server (requires PortAudio system library)
# The elevenlabs-mcp package is installed via uvx, but requires these system dependencies:
# - Linux: sudo apt-get install libportaudio2
# - macOS: brew install portaudio (usually auto-installs)
# - Windows: Usually auto-installs with pip

# Note: No Python packages need to be installed manually.
# The elevenlabs-mcp MCP server handles all audio dependencies.
